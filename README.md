# Computer Science Student Chatbot

This is a Full-stack development Chatbot using C#, Vue.js, CSS, HTML, JavaScript, and SQL. The application is a Chatbot that answers computer science curriculum questions, gives job application advice, inspires users with motivational quotes, and finds open job positions as they are listed in real time. I definitely plan to add more on the backend of this project to expand its utilities. This is somewhat of a BETA version of what it will ultimately look like, but it is still fully functional for its current purposes.
